In the months since the AFUE final report was released (8/20/2020), California more than doubled its previous record of total annual acres burned, hundreds of people (including firefighters) were airlifted out of potential burnovers, two more aerial firefighters lost their lives in the line of duty, and Australia entered another busy fire season months ahead of schedule. Given the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is easy to understand that a highly technical, retrospective analysis of a relatively narrow aspect of wildland firefighting might seem irrelevant. Sadly, accepting this viewpoint will doom the wildland firefighting community to a vicious cycle. The AFUE study was about far more than what some airtankers did from 2012-2019.

Consider that AFUE observed a small percent of all drops made during 2015-2018, yet the total number of AFUE drops analyzed still amounted to 27,611. Of those, the report estimates that 40%, or about 11,000, were made to delay fire/retard spread. How did those drops work out? It turns out that the report provides a great deal of analysis that doesn't quite give a direct answer. Since I led the study for the majority of its existence, the following explanation is exact, even though the report and other released AFUE information don't provide supporting references.

At the start, AFUE identified three distinct sources of data, which were planned to feed three interlocking "prongs" of analysis during the intensive study: expert field observer data collection, aircraft fleet automated data records (AFF, ATU and airworthiness reporting systems), and aerial/satellite imagery. The field observer source ended up being the only fully successful data collection effort, but even that failed to transition to a proposed system that would have gathered data from a tactical decision-support tool developed to provide line firefighters with probability of success (Ps) estimates for planned actions such as airtanker or helicopter drops based on available aircraft and current local conditions. The part of the study that suffered the most from the failure of the other two data collection efforts was the plan to calculate delay duration when fire encountered drops. Although this is a scientifically complex problem to solve, AFUE intended to collect tens of thousands of observations by connecting drop location and time data to geospatially rectified aerial imagery and directly measuring changes in fire rates of spread when drops were encountered. AFUE did manage to collect a small amount of data during a couple months when an aircraft dedicated to the study used a mapping sensor while observing fires with aircraft activities, but unknown editors outside the AFUE study removed this discussion from the final report.

So what does delay/retard spread mean in terms of the existing AFUE dataset? It means that the AFUE data collectors selected "delay/retard spread" as the drop objective 11,000 times between 2015 and 2018, and also chose a specific outcome for every one of those. The final report barely touches on this, but it is an important aspect of the entire study, especially for answering the question of what value AFUE has to offer the wildland firefighting community. Consider this: the firefighters who made the decisions about how to attack the fire were the ones who identified the objective. They had bigger plans than to have one drop slow a fire down. Ultimately, firefighters need to know if "buying time" actually helps them protect lives and property. Similarly, dispatchers need to know if sending half of the aircraft in a request is even worth it (many aerial supervisors will either order more than they think they need because they expect to have some denied, or say "give me everything, or don't send me anything"). Also, agency heads and appropriators need to know if, for instance, bulldozers do a better job in certain situations but aren't being used because there aren't enough of them.

The final report omitted the fact that every one of those drop observations included that bigger plan that the line firefighter had in mind, as well as the objectives of the rest of the command structure (division objectives and incident objectives). Every one of those objectives also had an outcome recorded for it. Pages 10 and 11 of the final report include part of this information, but the rest of the report ignores it. The data exists, and the study team did analysis. The nameless editors cut it out.

If there is a sense of frustration in this post, it is sincere. Not only did I spend a major part of my US Forest Service career dedicated to this study, I've also sought to carry the intent through to my new endeavors. In fact, after the Forest Service Chief failed for a third straight year to deliver on a promise to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to produce a report, I filed a Freedom of Information Act request this June for the records I left behind. After roughly twenty follow-ups, the agency still hasn't identified if compliant records are available. I find this incredible, since the request included specific file names, folder locations in the agency's official records management system and on removable media, as well as names and titles of current employees who have authorized access to and knowledge of the files.

I firmly refuse to believe there is any attempt to bury or cover up anything related to AFUE. I have good personal relationships with many of the people who are still involved and who have the power to change the course of this story. There are many problems that are contributing to the loss of the AFUE opportunity, and none of them are easy to fix. Two critical needs stand above all the others, however, and they affect much more than the potential for the AFUE study to make a positive impact: the Forest Service needs stable, strong, open fire management leadership, and it needs better funded, more operationally connected research and business managment divisions.
