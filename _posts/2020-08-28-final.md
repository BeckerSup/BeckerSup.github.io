title: 'What Next, AFUE?'

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report in 2013 that provided three recommendations  for the USDA Forest Service (USFS) and Department of Interior. The two agencies requested closure of all three recommendations, and GAO closed the first two with a status of "implemented," but later closed the final recommendation as "not implemented" because the agencies had not actually used the information that was collected in accordance with the first two recommendations to update strategy documents. [GAO's webpage for the report](https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-684) includes the details.

An important detail in the story of AFUE is that AFUE started before the GAO report was released, and the AFUE charter and mission were never specifically directed at addressing the GAO recommendations. One reason this is important is because GAO's recommendations were for _all_ types of firefighting aircraft, including, for instance, aerial supervision and smokejumper aircraft. AFUE has been focused primarily on fixed-wing scoopers, single-engine airtankers (SEATs), multi-engine large airtankers (LATs), and very large airtankers (VLATs). While the final report includes plenty of information on helicopters, the study's data collection methods were not designed for helicopters, and in many ways, comparisons between fixed-wing and rotor-wing performance and effectiveness based on AFUE data will be biased because they leave out important distinctions between the types.

The GAO report included a very useful graphic that highlighted what type of information was missing from Federal firefighting agency strategic planning for aviation:

The agencies have continued to update strategic planning documents since AFUE was started, and in fact requested closure of GAO's third recommendation based on the [2018 NIAC Strategic Plan](https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/docs/eb-fmb-m-18-002a.pdf), but GAO pointed out that the plan did not make use of any information or analysis, which was the entire point of the carefully worded recommendation. This was actually a restrained response, since the plan did not include any information from any study at all! Ironically, the plan's title more accurately describes what it is: a vision, not a plan. It would work well as a prologue to an implementation plan, but as it is, there are no discrete tasks, assignments of responsibility, or deadlines.

It's ironic that the AFUE final report lists the GAO recommendations and the AFUE mission in the first two paragraphs of the executive summary. One wonders if the anonymous authors purposefully chose this glaring proof of the mismatch to make a final statement. The reviewers, straight through to the Office of Management and Budget, apparently failed to recognize the fundamental problem with calling such a document "final."

There has been public speculation that the AFUE final report was suppressed or released so quietly because the findings were problematic for the agencies. This editing oversight fits an alternative explanation: no one in leadership positions actually cares what the report says. Consider that the study was initiated under a prior USFS Director and Assistant Director for Aviation, and three Chiefs have presided since its inception. None of the mid-level managers who were involved at the start remain in the same positions, and many of those positions are either currently vacant or had prolonged vacancies while the study was ongoing. Throw in an administration change, a complete budget overhaul (the ["fire fix"](https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/02/10/administration-requests-2-to-5-increases-in-fire-budgets/) that came with significant cuts to research budgets), and a [major sexual harassment scandal](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/they-reported-sexual-harassment-then-the-retaliation-began), and the theory becomes plausible. Since major USFS fire and aviation studies have been outsourced for decades, it was rather ambitious for the agency to in-source this one in the first place.

The difficulty comes in divining what comes next. The GAO recommendations are closed, but [Congress continues to pressure the USFS](https://www.energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2018/6/full-committee-hearing-to-examine-the-2018-wildland-06-05-2018) to ensure that aviation dollars are spent wisely. Close reading of the third GAO recommendation reveals the opinion of the authors: "..._update_ the agency's strategy documents..." could be interpreted to mean that the past strategy documents used sound methods, but lacked good data. It's clear that GAO read and understood the strengths and limitations of those past studies. Actually redoing past analyses using current information is not a strange concept, and it might prove to be more efficient than reinventing the wheel. 

In the meantime, consider that the top-line finding from AFUE is that roughly three drops out of four meet or exceed their objective. That's pretty good, but with a [2017 fire aviation budget of nearly half a billion dollars](https://fireaviation.com/2019/04/08/after-seven-years-of-the-air-tanker-effectiveness-study-what-have-we-learned/), just finding ways to improve that performance by small amounts has the potential to save serious money and make wildland firefighting more effective. Future posts will explore ways this could be done using findings from the final report.
