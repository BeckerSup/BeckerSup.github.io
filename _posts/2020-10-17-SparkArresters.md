In 2020, the western United States is once again facing a historic fire season, with over 8.3 million acres burned (an area greater than the sizes of New Jersey and Delaware combined). In California, [five of the ten largest fires in state history](https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11416/top20_acres.pdf) have occurred in 2020, blackening over 2.4 million acres, costing 22 lives, and destroying nearly 6,000 structures. 

Although lightning-caused wildfires do occur, the vast majority of fires result from human action. From 2001-2018, people caused an average of 60,467 wildland fires in the United States, [burning more than 2.7 million acres per year](https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_human.html). While some human-caused fires are intentional (arson), most are accidental. Common accidental sources include equipment failures, hot work, discarded smoking materials, debris burning, fireworks, and escaped campfires. 

The use of motorized equipment is a frequent accidental cause of wildland fires. Equipment like ATVs, chainsaws, weed trimmers, and even stationary devices like generators and power washers can present significant fire risk. Potential ignition sources include hot engine/exhaust surfaces, friction (dragging tow chains, improperly functioning brake systems), and the ejection of hot gases and debris from exhaust systems. 

A failed diesel exhaust system caused the devastating [Apple Fire](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/6902/) in Riverside County in July 2020, which burned over 33,000 acres and forced thousands of local residents to flee their homes. Fire officials spent tens of millions of dollars suppressing the fire and placed nearly 1,000 firefighters in harm's way to stop its progression. As of October 2020, the fire continues to burn, with full containment not expected until the end of 2020.

To address fire risks posed by exhaust system failures, the US Congress has [mandated the use of spark arrester systems on federal lands](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/36/261.52). Spark arresters are mechanical devices designed to prevent the ejection of hot exhaust debris from internal combustion engines. The federal regulations have been adopted by many other states, municipalities, and even foreign countries, [including Australia](https://www.productsafety.gov.au/standards/quad-bikes). Technical requirements for spark arresters are dictated in US Forest Service Standard [FS5100-1D](https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/programs/fire/documents/FS5100-1D.pdf), and to be compliant with regulations, spark arrester systems must be tested by the US Forest Service in accordance with FS5100-1D and listed in the US Forest Serviceâ€™s [Spark Arrester Guide](https://www.fs.fed.us/t-d/php/library_card.php?p_num=0951%201804P). 

To have their product listed in the Spark Arrester Guide, equipment manufacturers must submit their spark arrester systems to the US Forest Service for evaluation. Failure to understand the requirements of the process can result in costly production delays and the forfeiture of testing fees.

Becker Support provides specialized consulting services using licensed Professional Engineers to assist equipment manufacturers in the design and Federal qualification process for spark arrester systems. Services include:

Spark arrester design/manufacturing consulting to assess compliance with the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J350 test standard (Spark Arrester Test Procedure for Medium Sized Engines)
Management of the qualification process on behalf of the manufacturer, including the submission of products for qualification by the United States Forest Service and other certifying agencies

Our consulting engineers have direct experience with the Federal spark arrester qualification process and can help guide clients through the process, preventing costly delays in product development. 

Becker Support engineering consultants also have extensive experience in the forensic investigation of equipment-caused wildfires, and can help clients determine if faulty equipment may have been responsible for starting a fire.
