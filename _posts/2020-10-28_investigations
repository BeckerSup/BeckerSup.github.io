In 2020, investigations happen. [five of the ten largest fires in state history](https://www.fire.ca.gov/media/11416/top20_acres.pdf) have occurred in 2020, blackening over 2.4 million acres, costing 22 lives, and destroying nearly 6,000 structures. 

Although lightning-caused wildfires do occur, the vast majority of fires result from human action. From 2001-2018, people caused an average of 60,467 wildland fires in the United States, [burning more than 2.7 million acres per year](https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_stats_human.html). While some human-caused fires are intentional (arson), most are accidental. Common accidental sources include equipment Blah blah blah
