The world is in a singular moment. We have a highly contagious and dangerous disease outpacing medical research and public health measures designed to mitigate and contain it. In a time when quick fixes rule the public consciousness, we are seeing failure after failure, forcing painful fallbacks to strict personal isolation on societal scales. It seems like all the rules we have learned throughout our lives have been broken.

The public safety and first responder workforce is faced with a particularly surreal existence. While events such as team sports of any kind and crowd-generating events like concerts disappeared overnight, we continue to respond to extreme weather, public safety threats, infrastructure failures, and wildfires. How can we maintain readiness, recruit new talent, manage our facilities, and effectively deal with drastically shifting public opinions of our government's priorities in such an unfamiliar environment?

Of course, there is no quick fix. The playbook for this confluence of events was never written. We're all making it up as we go, but the fact is, we're not in this alone. Every agency, every department, every squad is having to improvise. Some things will work and some won't, but by staying in contact and sharing experiences, we'll be able to make decisions more quickly and weed out the less effective approaches.

We also need to start looking for alternatives to traditional tools and methods. Can your supervisors and employees find ways to connect without regular face-to-face meetings? Is training being reimagined to emphasize offsite availability and virtual collaboration? Perhaps now is a good time to focus on capturing lessons learned from the veterans of your organization and using their experiences in a targeted way to extend the scope and effectiveness of advanced training.
