title: The Importance of Institutional Learning

California commenced its latest fire siege with a dry lightning bust on August 15. Ten days later, over 1.25 million acres have been burned, and the lightning hasn't stopped. Cal Fire reports that more than 14,000 firefighters are currently assigned to fires. In the last ten days, there have been 650 new fires and 13,000 lightning strikes; with only about 200 strikes on the first day and yesterday, that means the intervening eight days averaged 1,575 strikes per day! In a state that is [not known for naturally caused wildfires](https://beckersup.github.io/CauseandEffect/), this evokes the recently worn-out but brutally accurate moniker of being unprecedented.

This post isn't about the current California wildfire situation. Few in the wildland fire community will be paying attention to the opinions or observations of anyone on the sidelines until the rains come anyway. This post is about what we make of the situation we're handed. It's something to think about once we've made it home, cleaned up, gotten some rest, and we start to process what happened. It's a checklist, if you will, for people who live by training, discipline and order. It's important because sometimes what we've done before doesn't have the effect it used to have, and if we don't figure out why, we're in danger of letting it happen again.

The fundamental principle of wildland fire suppression and control is to remove fuel between the fire and what you want to protect. Wildland firefighters learn about the fire triangle in their first day of training, specifically the concept that removing any side of the triangle causes it to collapse, which puts the fire out. Practically speaking, removing the oxygen from a fire progressing across a landscape so that the fire permanently stops advancing is completely impossible, and only natural weather changes (especially significant wetting rain or snow) can remove enough heat from a significant fire front (longer than a couple hundred yards) to actually put the fire out. In recognition of this fact, wildland firefighting agencies have become very good at removing fuel from the path of advancing fire, and generally enjoy frequent success - [the current Chief of the Forest Service even claims a 98% success rate](https://www.opb.org/news/article/forest-fire-management-fuel-treatments/) - but failure has a [tremendously high, and rising, cost](https://www.nifc.gov/fireInfo/fireInfo_documents/SuppCosts.pdf). In many situations, there simply isn't enough time or resources to take any suppression actions. Making and executing plans in these situations is demanding at best.

When people execute a plan correctly, but the results fail to meet intentions, there are two easy explanations: either someone must have messed up, or the outcome was a fluke. Investigation reports often dress up these basic conclusions with great formality and expert testimony. The harder but more worthwhile challenge in the investigation process is to ask exactly when did the plan fail to account for the situation at hand, and what alternatives were available at that moment? Answering these questions enables institutional learning. It is high time to take up this challenge for wildland fire, and to do it on an ambitious scale.

This is an individual challenge as much as it is an organizational challenge. This is where our heroes, the dirty, sleep-deprived, blistered, seasoned veterans - even the first-year survivors, since years like this count for more than one - can contribute to organizational change in a way that has not been possible before. The need has never been greater. If you're part of this class, please consider capturing a list of answers to the following questions for every situation (i.e. fire, shift, or other significant event) you recently experienced where things did not go according to plan. Bringing your experiences together with those of others will reveal common threads and ways to deal with new realities. Your questions are:

    -What was the situation?
    -What was the plan?
    -When did you first realize that things were not going according to the plan?
    -What caused the change?
    -What alternatives to the next steps in the plan were available at that time?
    -What alternatives could have preserved the intended outcome?
    
It's easy to become fixated on failures. While failures are almost always the events we need to deal with later, institutional changes can result in a worse overall situation if the current success rate is not accounted for when planning those changes. For that reason, also capture how many fires did go according to plan for you this season.

Putting this list together might reveal some hidden lessons in your own experiences. The true value in the exercise, though, is in building a collective experience. Let your supervisor know about this assignment and share your list. Encourage them to create their own list, compare it with yours, and network with their peers. Push the collective learning outward and upward. We all need to be ready to rethink how we do our job, and by starting the change, you help set the direction. Have confidence and faith that good ideas float to the top. Continue to talk about this challenge and your results. Learn from others and add their experience to yours. This blog will circle back to this challenge, and the principles behind it will inform many more posts to come.
